# count.surge.sh

(Branch `rewrite`)

* What it can do: Same as [the old-fashioned one](https://github.com/outloudvi/count.surge.sh/tree/master).
* Tools and frameworks involved:
    * TypeScript (most importantly, and helped me a lot)
    * Redux (of the same importance as TypeScript)
    * Webpack (somehow hard to configure)
    * Bootstrap (great companion, bro)
    * jQuery (really, really great companion)
    * Popper.js (used in the previous version)
* Cool feature: Undo (Thank you Redux)
* Not-so-cool feature: Load static files from cdnjs.loli.net
